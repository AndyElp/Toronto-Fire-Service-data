# Toronto Fire Service Data Analysis

This project analyzes fire incident data from Toronto, focusing on key factors such as **location**, **time of occurrence**, and **cause**. The goal is to understand patterns in fire incidents and provide possible stratergies for prevention efforts. The analysis is conducted using **Tableau** for visual storytelling, alongside **data cleaning** and **transformation** in Python and other tools.

## Project Overview

The dataset includes fire incident records over multiple years, allowing for a detailed analysis of:

- **Where fires most frequently occur** (e.g., kitchen, bedroom).
- **When fires are most likely to happen**, with a particular focus on **evening hours**.
- The role of **human error** as a major contributing factor to fire incidents.

### Key Insights

1. **Kitchens are the most common place for fires to start.**
2. **Evening hours (5 PM - 9 PM) show a spike in fire incidents.**
3. **Human error is the leading cause of fire incidents.**

## Visualizations

The project features various Tableau dashboards, including:

- **Incident Counts over Time:** Visualizing fire incidents over time to identify any trends.
- **Fire Incident Locations:** A breakdown of where fires are most likely to start within homes or businesses.
- **Time of Day Analysis:** Highlighting the most dangerous hours for fire incidents.
- **Causes of Fire:** Understanding what factors contribute most to fire occurrence, with a focus on human error.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw and cleaned datasets used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, transformation, and basic exploratory analysis.
- `tableau/`: Contains the Tableau workbook used for creating visualizations.

## Tools
